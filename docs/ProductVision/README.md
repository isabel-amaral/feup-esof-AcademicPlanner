## Product Vision

### Vision Statement

A simple and intuitive feature to allow students to conciliate their university schedule with their extracurricular activities in a more organized way, therefore increasing their productivity.

### Main Features
- **Calendar** - An ‘Agenda’ page needs to be created. This will be implemented similarly to the ‘Horário’ page but, because there might be some activities that aren’t weekly, we need to do this through a calendar.


- **Customizable schedule** - The user has the possibility to add and delete any extra activities beyond classes and exams, which are already present in uni. For example: project deliveries, gym sessions, ‘Tuna’ rehearsals, ‘Praxe’ sessions, Student branch meetings etc.
 

- **Customizable activity frequency** - Every time a new activity is created, the user can define if it should be repeated daily, weekly or monthly.

### Extra Features
- **Color tags** - The user may select a different color for each activity. This allows them to organize different activities in categories based on their colors.
 

- **Notifications** - The user may also have the possibility to enable notification a certain amount of time before any activity.

### Assumptions and dependencies
- Student timetable from sigarra


- Exams dates from sigarra


- Server to store the new user defined activities
