#### Release

#### Iteration Retrospective

Everything that was planned was done successfully, however it was not possible to implement unit tests.
In addition, the acceptance tests were written, however, due to a version conflict, it was not possible to execute them.
We learned to work better with flutter, which will help us in future iterations.

#### Iteration Retrospective

Despite having planned more work items for this iteration than we did for the last one, which were also generally more time consuming, we managed to complete every task and everything seems to be working fine. Our first plan was to use Firebase as a way to store each user’s activities, however we had a lot of trouble fetching the information correctly and save it locally for display so, after meeting with the class’s monitors, we decided to ditch the idea. The short term solution found was to just have a class with some initial hardcoded activities, this isn’t a good solution since it doesn’t allow the activities to be user specific or to be kept after logging out, but was a good enough foundation for us to be able to complete the remaining work items. <br>
Because of the technical problems with both firebase and running the acceptance tests we didn’t have the time, once again, to test our features appropriately. Nonetheless we will make testing one of our primary focus areas for the next iteration.
