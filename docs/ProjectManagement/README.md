#### Iteration Retrospective

  Everything that was planned was done successfully, however it was not possible to implement unit tests.
  In addition, the acceptance tests were written, however, due to a version conflict, it was not possible to execute them.
  We learned to work better with flutter, which will help us in future implementations.
