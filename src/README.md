## Customizable Calendar

The goal of this project is to develop a feature that could be present in [uni](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.up.fe.ni.uni), 
a mobile application built by the students of NIAEFEUP to make the lives of FEUP students easier.

In order to start implementing our feature, we used the codebase for the app that can be found in the master branch
of their [repository](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/project-schrodinger).
